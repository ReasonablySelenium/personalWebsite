title: Before You Follow (BYF)
---
Following me and chatting directly with me is greatly appreciated. However, there are several things you should know before attempting to engage a companionship with me. A unified form of guidelines and expediencies helps clear any misunderstandings and confusion along the way. I mainly wish to address some concerns about certain behaviors I may accidentally convey which may not be considered appropriate for a situation. If you have any questions, please message me on the appropriate social media platform privately.
