Scheduling posts using a dynamic website like WordPress is easier than baking a pie. Just a few clicks and the post ready to go live when the time comes. The server can take care of publishing that marvelous piece of content on the hour, and without delay automatically, assuming the server is currently online, and the end user only has to worry about creating the content to be displayed. However, if there is no server to manage scheduling, especially for static websites, the answer becomes a bit more complicated. Content simply can't update itself at the correct time.

For those who are using GitHub and NetlifyCMS, however, there is a solution that is easy to setup and manage without too much of a hassle. Even though there may not be a native protocol inside of the admin interface, and nevertheless considering the future of a native path for this from the developers at Netlify, tomorrow is closer than one could ever imagine. In fact, those who know how to use GitHub will be flattered to know that setup can be fully accomplished via the website itself. Screenshots of the process are recorded for reference and to clear any confusions which may be caused by accidental misappropriation.
